# Pico_Epaper

Both project are for the "4.2inch E-Paper E-Ink Display Module for Raspberry Pi Pico" module. This module is working very well with the python software example from waveshare.

But I want to use it with Arduino IDE. But I'm not yet able to make it working.

The "RP2040_EPaper_test" program use the GxEPD software and the "RP2040_EPaper_test2" use the GxEPD2 version.

Both are not working. I try to set the SPI pin out in different manner: using the setRX,setTX ecc.ecc. funcion or declaring the "#define" 
but am still in stuck.
